_Masterâ€™s student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University_

I am currently in [Computer Systems and Platforms Lab](https://csap.snu.ac.kr) and advised by [Prof. Bernhard Egger](https://csap.snu.ac.kr/bernhard).
My current research focuses on building efficient and reliable remote memory for the data center environment.

My goal is to build easy-to-use future generation systems with high performance and security.
As a potential systems researcher, I am currently focusing on distributed systems, operating systems, and systems security.

I received my B.E. in Mobile Systems Engineering from Dankook University.
During the program, I also worked as a research assistant at [Mobile Operating Systems Lab](https://mobile-os.dankook.ac.kr) and participated in multiple research projects covering systems security, hardware accelerator, and automated code generation.
My primary topics of research as an undergraduate RA were 1) building and maintaining a secure data processing environment for cloud computing and 2) implementing an automated testing framework with planned testing support.
