Hi! I am a Master's student in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University.
I am currently with [Computer Systems and Platforms Lab](https://csap.snu.ac.kr) and advised by [Prof. Bernhard Egger](https://csap.snu.ac.kr/bernhard).

My goal is to build easy-to-use future generation systems with high performance and security.
As a potential systems researcher, I've been working on various computer systems research topics relying on distributed systems, operating systems, and systems security.
My current research focuses on building efficient and reliable remote memory for data-center environment.
Also, I work on instantly live migrating virtual machines.

Previously, when I was a undergraduate research assistant at [Mobile Operating Systems Lab](https://mobile-os.dankook.ac.kr), I contributed to research projects covering systems security, hardware accelerator, and automated code generation.
My work had been focusing on building and maintaining secure data processing environment for cloud computing.
Also, I implemented automated testing framework that supports planned testing.

If you want to know more about me, please refer to my [CV](assets/cv.pdf).
