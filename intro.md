Hi! I am a M.S. Student in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University.
I am advised by [Prof. Bernhard Egger](https://csap.snu.ac.kr/bernhard)

My goal is to build easy-to-use future generation systems with high performance and security.
As a potential systems researcher, I've been working on various computer systems research topics relying on distributed systems, operating systems, and systems security.

If you want to know more about me, please refer to my [CV](assets/cv.pdf).
